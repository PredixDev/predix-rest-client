Predix Rest Client
==============

Welcome to Predix Rest Client, a [Microcomponent](https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-rmd-ref-app/blob/master/docs/microcomponents.md) Utility.

The predix-rest-client project provides standard GET, PUT, POST, DELETE with helpers to manage Predix OAuth Security in the cloud.  See the property files and [IOauthRestConfig.java](https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-boot/blob/master/predix-rest-client/src/main/java/com/ge/predix/solsvc/restclient/config/IOauthRestConfig.java) which allow a microservice to connect to Predix UAA (User Authentication and Authorization) servers in the cloud. All the reference app microservices use this utility to make Rest calls in the cloud.

1. Most of the time, you will make a dependency to predix-rest-client by adding this to your pom.xml
  
  ```xml
 	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.ge.predix.solsvc</groupId>
		<artifactId>predix-rest-client</artifactId>
		<version>${predix-rest-client.version}</version>
	</dependency>
  ```
  
1. If you started with a [Predix Microservice Template](https://github.com/predixdev/predix-microservice-templates) you will have a property in config/application.properties which spins up certain beans marked with the Local Profile.  Otherwise, add this property to your project.
  ```
  spring.profiles.active=local
  ```
  
1. You also will want to check that Autowiring of these package is occurring by adding this file to your spring context 
  ```xml
  	"classpath:META-INF/spring/predix-rest-client-scan-context.xml" 
  	
  	which contains
	<context:component-scan
            base-package="
		com.ge.predix.solsvc.restclient.config
		com.ge.predix.solsvc.restclient.impl
        " />

  ```
  
1. Or to view the source code you can download the project
